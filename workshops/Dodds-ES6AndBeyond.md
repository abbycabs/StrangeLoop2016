# ES6 and Beyond

The EcmaScript standard is now on a yearly release cycle. With ES6 complete and ES2016 ratified, we have a ton of awesome new features to use in our daily software development. In this training, we'll learn about the features you're likely to use and benefit from on a day-to-day basis. You'll get hands on experience trying out these new features with a test suite you'll be expected to make pass. After this training, you'll be able to go back to your projects and add support for ESNext code today.

This is a very hands-on training and you'll need to make sure that you're machine is ready. You will be coding and running code. Please ensure that you have git, Node, npm, and a text editor / IDE installed on your machine. With that, you'll be ready to rock and roll.
